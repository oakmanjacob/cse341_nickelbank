## Abstract



## Functionality

Nickel offers a variety of banking services to its customers:
• Accounts: Nickel offers both savings and checking accounts. These accounts differ in their interest
rates and in the types of transactions allowed. An account may belong to a single customer or may
be owned jointly by more than one. dao.Account balances are maintained. Checking accounts may have
a minimum balance (check with bank management for details) and penalties when a customer goes
below that minimum balance. Savings accounts are not permitted to be overdrawn.

• Loans: Nickel offers two types of loans. Mortgages are secured by the customer(s)’ home. Unsecured
loans are exactly that, unsecured. Loans have an interest rate, an amount, and a monthly payment.
• Payment cards: Nickel offers both a debit and a credit card. Debit cards are tied to a checking account.
Credit cards have an interest rate, a credit limit, a running balance, and a balance due.

• Branch banking: Nickel has several physical locations. Some offer only an ATM. Nickel ATMs allow
debit-card holders to withdraw cash and check balances. No deposit services are offered at ATMs.
Other locations offer both an ATM and in-person transactions with a bank teller. These locations
accept deposits.

• Services NOT offered: Nickel, given its low-cost, low-feature, and somewhat archaic business strategy,
does not offer automated deposits and payments, and does not offer any form of online banking (neither
web nor smartphone). These may be added in a year when the bank will rename itself Fifty-Cent Bank,
hire a celebrity spokesperson, and become ten times better. Management may agree to an early rollout
of these features if the IT development team is ahead of schedule.

1. Bank management: Among the things this interface may offer are computation of total loans, total
accounts, totals on a per-customer basis, transaction frequency and dollar volume (per day, month,
year), activity at each branch (transaction frequency, dollar amounts, etc.)

2. dao.Account deposit/withdrawal: These happen at a branch (teller or ATM). Withdrawals cannot make a
savings account go negative; those must be declined. If a checking account withdrawal takes it below
the minimum balance a penalty must be imposed.

3. Payment on a loan or credit card.

4. Opening of a new account.

5. Obtaining a new or replacement credit or debit card.

6. Taking out a new loan.

7. Purchases using a card: If the card is a debit card, the balance in the associated checking account must
be sufficient to cover the purchase. If the card is a credit card, the outstanding balance on the card
after the transaction must not exceed the credit limit. In either of these cases, the purchase would be
declined. For this project, we shall not be monitoring details of the various vendors at which purchases
are made, beyond a vendor name and ID.

There are a variety of transactions that occur. Many of these are initiated by a customer and include
withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, purchases with a debit or credit card, loan payments, and credit
card balance payments.
